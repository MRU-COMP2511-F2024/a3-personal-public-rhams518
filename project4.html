        <h2 class="my-3">The Project</h2>
        <p>
            This ePortfolio is my most recent project. This project was designed as a showcase of my skills, knowledge, and work completed throughout the course. The goal was to create a professional platform where I could present my projects, provide brief descriptions of each, and reflect on my learning journey, including the challenges I faced, the mistakes I made, and how I grew as a result. Building the ePortfolio required me to incorporate core web development principles, including effective use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and forms for interactivity. A key aspect of the project was creating a responsive design to ensure the site looked and functioned well on various devices and screen sizes. Additionally, accessibility was a primary focus, ensuring that the site could be navigated and understood by all users, including those relying on assistive technologies. The ePortfolio also reflects my personal style and aims to balance creativity with professionalism.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="my-3">Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            This project presented several significant challenges that tested both my technical and creative abilities. Ensuring the website was fully responsive required the careful application of media queries, as well as extensive testing across different devices and screen sizes. I had to address layout issues and ensure that all elements, such as images and navigation menus, adapted seamlessly to varying resolutions. Another major challenge was designing and integrating a functional contact form. This involved learning and implementing proper validation techniques to enhance user experience while maintaining security. Striking the right balance between technical execution and creative content was also difficult; I wanted the website to be visually appealing while ensuring it remained easy to navigate and professional. Time management added another layer of complexity, as this was the first individual project of the semester. Dividing my efforts between perfecting the technical aspects and curating thoughtful reflections on my work required strategic planning and discipline.
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="my-3">What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
            Completing this ePortfolio project was a valuable learning experience that taught me both technical and personal lessons. I learned how to structure a professional ePortfolio, organizing content in a way that highlights my skills and achievements while making it accessible and engaging for viewers. Technically, I improved my abilities in responsive web design, gaining confidence in using media queries and flexible layouts to create a website that functions well across all devices. I also became more proficient in working with forms, learning how to implement interactive features like contact forms with proper validation to enhance user experience. Accessibility was a key focus throughout the project, and I now have a deeper understanding of how to design with inclusivity in mind, such as ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies and maintaining proper contrast ratios. On a personal level, this project helped me reflect on my growth, understand the importance of addressing challenges head-on, and articulate the lessons learned from both successes and setbacks.
