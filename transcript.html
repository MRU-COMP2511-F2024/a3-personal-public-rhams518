                Hello everyone, I wanted to briefly share my journey to my current program and what I’ve learned along the way. After high school, I decided to take a gap year. I knew I wanted to go to university but wasn’t sure which program to pursue. During that year, I worked as a receptionist at a massage clinic. As an introvert who struggled in new social situations, this job was challenging at first. I had to get comfortable answering phones, greeting clients, and learning the clinic’s operations. Over time, I became much more confident in these areas and developed better communication skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, I started at the University of Calgary in the chemistry program. While I learned a lot, I eventually realized it wasn’t the right fit for me. I then took some computer science courses and really enjoyed them, especially the problem-solving and programming aspects. However, I felt the program at U of C wasn’t fully aligned with my interests, so I looked into other options.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s when I discovered the Computer Information Systems program at Mount Royal University. I loved the mix of computer science and business courses, along with the opportunity to gain work experience through the co-op program. I continued to work at the small business mentioned previously, which was a passionate and dedicated environment. Unfortunately, as I was transitioning to MRU, the business faced financial difficulties due to the economic downturn and had to close.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I was able to find another similar job at a more stable clinic. It was interesting to see how one business closed and the other continues to operate and the factors that cause the respective outcomes. This experience taught me a valuable lesson about how businesses can thrive or struggle based on various factors. It made me realize the importance of resilience and strategic decision-making in business.
            </p>
            <p>
                And now that I am continuing my Education as a BCIS student at mount royal I am excited to take what I have and will learn into my future careers with me.
