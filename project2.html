    <h2 class="my-3">The Project</h2>
    <p>
        For this project, we were tasked with creating a website to showcase what we learned in class. For example, using HTML features, such as tables, lists, forms, and semantic elements to effectively structure  content. On the CSS side, we demonstrated skills such as styling with classes and IDs for targeted customization, and we enhanced the visual appeal of the site through thoughtful selection of fonts and colors. After completing the initial iteration, we were challenged to take our project further by reformatting it using modern layout techniques like Flexbox or Grid, which required a deeper understanding of CSS concepts. To elevate the user experience, we made the website fully responsive by employing media queries and designing layouts that adapted gracefully to various screen sizes. Beyond aesthetics and functionality, we prioritized accessibility by incorporating features like descriptive alt text for images, a logical heading hierarchy for screen readers, and keyboard navigation compatibility. This holistic approach ensured that the website was inclusive for a wide audience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="my-3">Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        The project presented several challenges that pushed me to expand my skills and think critically about web development. One of the most significant hurdles was designing with accessibility in mind. This required an in-depth exploration of ARIA roles to improve navigation for assistive technologies, understanding and implementing semantic HTML for better content structure, and ensuring proper contrast ratios to enhance readability for users with visual impairments. Another challenge was making the website responsive. Adjusting elements like tables, images, and navigation menus to display seamlessly across devices required careful planning, the use of media queries, and experimenting with flexible layouts to achieve an optimal design. Striking a balance between functionality and aesthetics was also difficult; I wanted the site to look professional and visually appealing without sacrificing simplicity or usability. Debugging posed its own set of obstacles, particularly when working with Flexbox or Grid. Small issues, such as unexpected alignment problems or elements behaving differently across browsers, often required significant time and patience to resolve.
    </p>

    <h2 class="my-3">What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
        This project was a transformative learning experience that allowed me to build and refine a wide range of web development skills. On the technical side, I became more confident in using HTML elements like tables, forms, and semantic tags to create structured, accessible content. I also gained hands-on experience with CSS, learning how to utilize Flexbox and Grid for creating dynamic layouts, as well as media queries to make the website responsive across various devices. Beyond coding, I developed a greater appreciation for the importance of accessibility. From adding descriptive alt text for images to structuring headings logically and designing with assistive technologies in mind, I learned how to create websites that are inclusive and user-friendly for everyone. Overall, the project strengthened not only my technical expertise but also my understanding of how thoughtful design and development practices can make technology more accessible.
