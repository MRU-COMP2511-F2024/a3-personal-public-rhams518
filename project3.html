    <h2 class="my-3">The Project</h2>
    <p>
        This essay delves into the intersectional experiences of women of color, drawing insights from the film <i>Hidden Figures</i> and Max Gordon's article "The Way Forward." The film provides a compelling narrative of three African American women—Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson—who worked at NASA during the 1960s. Despite their groundbreaking contributions to science and space exploration, they faced systemic barriers stemming from both racism and sexism, which often compounded their struggles. Gordon’s article offers a complementary perspective by examining how his identity as a Black gay man creates unique experiences of marginalization and resilience. Together, these works underscore the necessity of recognizing the overlapping forms of oppression that individuals face, such as race, gender, and sexual orientation. By weaving together these narratives, the essay highlights the importance of understanding intersectionality as a framework to address complex societal inequalities and to foster meaningful social progress.
    </p>

    <h2 class="my-3">Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        Writing this essay presented several significant challenges, particularly in analyzing the nuanced intersections of racism and sexism faced by the characters in <i>Hidden Figures</i>. It required a thoughtful examination of how each aspect of their identity—race, gender, and occasionally class—shaped their personal and professional struggles. Another challenge was connecting the individual narratives of the women in the film to Gordon's broader theoretical arguments on intersectionality. Gordon’s insights into the layered discrimination faced by individuals at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities required careful contextualization alongside the film’s historical setting. Additionally, organizing the essay in a way that clearly presented the parallels between the film and the article posed a structural challenge. Balancing the storytelling elements of <i>Hidden Figures</i> with the analytical depth of Gordon’s argument demanded a clear and cohesive approach to ensure the connections between their experiences and the concept of intersectional oppression were effectively conveyed.

    <h2 class="my-3">What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
        This project provided invaluable lessons on the importance of understanding and analyzing intersectional identities. By exploring the lives of women of color in <i>Hidden Figures</i> and Gordon's personal reflections, I gained a deeper appreciation of the unique forms of oppression that emerge when race, gender, and other identities intersect. I also developed a greater awareness of how systemic barriers impact women of color in STEM fields, especially during historical moments of progress and change. Furthermore, the project reinforced the significance of adopting an intersectional lens when addressing social issues, as it ensures that all marginalized identities are considered and validated in conversations about equality and inclusion. On a practical level, this essay taught me how to connect theoretical frameworks with real-world examples, strengthening my ability to build arguments that advocate for social change. Overall, the experience deepened my critical thinking skills and broadened my perspective on the complexities of discrimination and resilience.
