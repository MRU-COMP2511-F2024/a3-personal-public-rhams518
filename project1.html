    <h2 class="my-3">The Project</h2>
    <p>
        Tasked with 24 hours to answer the 2024 Hackathon’s prompt—“How can we leverage technology to promote peace and inclusivity in society?”—we developed a tool that helps people in marginalized communities easily discover safe, inclusive spaces that meet their specific needs. Whether someone is searching for a welcoming coffee shop, a clothing store that offers adaptive fashion, or a bar that prioritizes sensory-friendly environments, our platform acts as a reliable, user-friendly resource. The core of our platform focuses on promoting values such as LGBTQ+ friendliness, accessibility, and sensory inclusivity. By offering a searchable database with filters that cater to diverse preferences, we aim to foster a sense of belonging and encourage positive social change through technology.
    </p>

    <h2 class="my-3">Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        Participating in my first hackathon was a thrilling and challenging experience, as the prompt and significant time constraint pushed me to think creatively and act quickly. Deciding on which features to prioritize was the biggest hurdle presented by the 24-hour time limit . One compromise was to focus on implementing search functionality and user accessibility as core components of our platform, while setting aside additional ideas for future iterations. Another major challenge was gathering reliable data on inclusive spaces: we wanted to ensure our information was accurate and representative to truly serve marginalized communities. Team coordination also became essential to success, especially since our group had varying levels of experience: we had to divide tasks efficiently, communicate clearly, and adapt quickly to unexpected roadblocks. On the technical side, one of my personal challenges was learning to create a responsive website for the first time. Since this skill was not covered in my coursework yet, I had to rely on individual and collaborative learning to achieve our goals.    </p>

    <h2 class="my-3">What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
        Participating in this hackathon provided me with a wealth of learning opportunities and personal growth. From a technical perspective, I learned how to design and build a responsive website, which was a significant milestone for me as it required skills beyond what I had encountered in my classes. I also gained valuable hands-on experience using tools like Figma, for creating intuitive designs, and Flexbox, for structuring responsive layouts. These skills not only enhanced the aesthetics of our platform, but also improved its overall useability. Coordinating tasks effectively with my teammates taught me how to delegate responsibilities based on individual strengths, prioritize critical tasks under a tight deadline, and remain flexible. Overall, this experience reinforced the values of collaboration, strategic problem-solving, and continuous learning to achieve ambitious goals. I look forward to using what I learned during my next Hackathon, and continuing to grow my skills.
